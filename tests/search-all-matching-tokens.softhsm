# This test checks if the search for objects in tokens will continue past the
# first token found.
#
# Generic PKCS#11 URIs are used to make the search to match more than one
# token. The search should be able to find the objects in each device, which are
# labeled differently per token.
#
# This test also contains a negative test to verify that the engine will not try
# to login to a token if more than one token matched the search. This is why it
# is required to have only one match to be able to use a private key.
