If you are subscribed to the mailing list, your posting will be distributed
immideatly. If you are not subscribed, it will be put on hold, till someone has
reviewed it so we can filter spam. We usualy review postings at least once a day,
so be patient. You can also cancel the posting, subscribe to the mailing list
and post again.
</p>
<h2>Bug reports</h2>
<p>
Please file bug reports using the <a class="ext-link" title="http://www.opensc.org/libp11/newticket" href="http://www.opensc.org/libp11/newticket" shape="rect">new ticket</a> link.
You can also send bug reports to bugs@opensc.org via email.
</p>
<h2>Greylisting</h2>
<p>
The opensc.org and lists.opensc.org mail servers are protected from spam by using a mechanism
called greylisting. Usualy this only causes a short delay for the first mail we receive from
you, and no trouble at all. Still if for whatever reason you cannot send mail to opensc.org,
please contact Andreas Jellinghaus at aj@dungeon.inka.de. Thanks.
