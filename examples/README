Libp11 example code
===================

This directory contains some example code how to use libp11.

auth.c		Example for authentication, i.e. get the first
		token, get the first certificate, ask for pin,
		login, sign some random data, and verify the
		signature using the certificate/public key.

For easy building see the Makefile in this directory. If you
are using autoconf/automake/libtool, you might want to add
to your configure.ac file:

PKG_CHECK_MODULES([LIBP11], [libp11])

and to your Makefile.am:

bin_PROGRAMS = myapp

myapp_CFLAGS = @LIBP11_CFLAGS@
myapp_LIBADD = @LIBP11_LIBS@
myapp_SOURCES = myapp.c
